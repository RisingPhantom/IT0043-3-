                    <p>While Boruto and the others are forced to participate in Ouga's experiments, Team 7 search for
                        Boruto and the other missing people in Konoha. On the other hand, when Boruto hears about there
                        being an underling of Ouga's among them, he is puzzled by the unexpected person as the
                        "underllng". After hearing that, he & the remaining subjects are sent to the next experiment
                        where they are given a random number card that represents the number of points they have. Ouga
                        then states that the objective of the experiment is to get seven points or higher to pass.
                        During the experiment, Boruto finds two subjects who were killed by someone, regardless of the
                        objective of the experiment.</p>
